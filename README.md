# i386
i386-RBLX: A x86-32 (x86/IA-32/i386) emulator for ROBLOX, I consider this project complete, I managed to run a basic C++ program compiled with GCC and that's good enough for me. This as a CPU is nowhere near done even so, because x86 is a massive ISA. If anyone wants to fork this and continue it, feel free, I'd love to see it.

You add new instructions by editing files in the following directory:
"src" > "compiler" > "Instruction Prototypes"



The current way to test machine code is completely manual, it can be found here:
"src" > "init" > "i386 init.server.lua" in the local variable "machineCode"

This emulator obviously isn't perfect, but I'm still proud of it.
